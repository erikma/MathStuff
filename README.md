Sometimes people pose problems that you just gotta solve.

## IrrationalNumberCalculator
It started with an implementation in C# (.NET Core) of the [Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe algorithm](https://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/20010.5.shtml) for calculating pi, using the Rational and BigNumber classes.

Then someone asked to repeat for [Euler's Number e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)), in this case using the series sum of 1/factorial values.
